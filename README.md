This       is a readme for SimpleGames.

We are looking to make a website containing various games from all the developers of the website. Everyone will contribute a game to the website; they can create whatever kind of game they like in order to provide a place where people can

Site design, we'll probably go with cyan blue (R0,G255,B255) and light gray (R192,G192,B192).

Pls make your coming soon image/game icon 256px by 256px. It does not have to be a masterpeice. These should be up by next monday
